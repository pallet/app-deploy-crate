    "Settings for an application.

`:app-root`
: the root of the install location (default /opt)

`:artifacts`

: a sequence of artifact maps.  An artifact map is keyed on resolver, with
  `:from-lein` and `:from-maven-repo` resolvers being supported.  All resolvers
  accept a sequence of maps.  Each map specifies a `:path`, which is the path
  relative to `:app-root` or an absolute path, and optionally an `:unpack` flag,
  which can be set to unpack an archive.  The `:from-lein` resolver expects a
  `:project-path`, a path to a project artifact, which may contain a \"%s\"
  which will be substituted with the project version.  The `:from-maven-repo`
  resolver expects a `:coord`, which is a leiningen style coordinate vector.

`:repositories`
: a map of leiningen style repository definitions, used by the
  `:from-maven-repo` resolver.

`:supervision`
: a keyword selecting the supervision service to be used.  Defaults to
  `:runit`.

`:run-command`
: a string that can be used as a command to start the application.

`:user`
: the user to use for running the application."
